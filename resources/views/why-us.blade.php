Temps are also very keen to learn as each new skills provides them with an additional opportunity to find assignments. This is beneficial to your company as the work will be done with new creativity and analytical skills.</p>
                        <p>The temp that works in your organisation will be well groomed, well-spoken and overall very presentable. Your company’s image will be upheld at all costs. This is important to the temp as his / her working prospects depend on positive feedback from each employer after the completion of the assignment.</p>
